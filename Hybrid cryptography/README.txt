An implementation of a complex system allowing the user the main security services.

It has the implementation of digital signature using a hash function (SHA-256) and RSA cipher.

The process of encryption is developed using AES, first is generated a random key for AES,
then the file is encrypted with that key, after that the key is encrypted
using RSA.
